# HackTheBox - A 30-Day Beginner Challenge.


## Week #1: Lab Creation & Starting Point
Setup your HackTheBox lab environment with VirtualBox and Kali Linux. Connect to VirtualBox using OpenVPN. Follow along with the “Starting Point” modules. Complete the 4 free modules in tier 0. You will still be able to continue forward without a VIP subscription for the “VIP Tiers”.

## Week #2: Tier 1 and 2 Starting Point Modules
Complete Tier 1 and 2 from the “Starting Point” modules. Tier 1 focuses on fundamental exploitation techniques. Tier 2 are full-fledged machines and chain multiple steps together. You’ll need to enumerate, gain an initial foothold, and escalate your privileges to reach root/system.

## Week #3: Hacking Labs
Finish Tier 2 from “Starting Point” if not completed already. Then begin with the two retired free machines with the official write-ups provided. Follow along with written guides directly from HackTheBox. Take notes and follow along step-by-step. Ideally the two free boxes will be labeled as easy.

## Week #4: Capstone
HackTheBox offers 13 free retired boxes. Choose whichever 2 boxes to work on. Try to stick with easy and medium tiered machines. Follow along with write-ups and videos sourced from the Internet. Attempt one easy machine and one medium machine without any written guides. When stuck, search for hints if possible before referencing written guides.
